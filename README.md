# BittrexArbitrageBot
Checks if it is possible to arbitrage for a specific coin/token. An example is BTC -> LTC - > ETH -> BTC. This skips the need to move coins between exchanges

# Usage
```bash
npm install
```
Add API keys for bittrex to the top of the arbitrageBot.js file
```bash
node arbitrageBot.js
```

# TODO
Bot is currently incomplete (unable to trade). This is since After running the code, I'm unable to find winning trades while scanning.
